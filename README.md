Send SMS within your workflows.

### Usage
You can use this action to send messages about the events happening to your repository. In this example, whenever someone opens a new issue on the repository, there will be an SMS sent to your phone.

```yml
name: Issue-opening Notifier
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master

      - name: Sending SMS
        uses: lnxpy/kavenegar_action@v0.1.0
        with:
          api_key: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
          receptor: ${{ secrets.RECEPTOR }}
          message: ${{ github.event.issue.title }} is opened on your repository!
```

Keep in mind to set the `secrets`. Here is a [quick guide](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) about it. Generate `API_KEY` from your profile dashboard on [Kavenegar](https://kavenegar.com/).
